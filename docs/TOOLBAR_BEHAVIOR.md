# Main-window toolbar behaviour

This file is the contract for the toolbar and its panels. Claude decides the UI; GPT implements it (user decision, 2026-10-20).

- **Code:** `SpotifyLyrics/Views/MainWindow/V3ToolbarModel.swift`
- **Checks:** `V3ToolbarPresentationTests` (via `Tests/v3_toolbar_model_contract.sh`)
- **Screenshots:** `Scripts/ui-snapshots.sh`

To change a rule, update this file and the tests first, and attach before/after snapshots. Keep the tests to the rules written here.

## Buttons
Order: 歌词库 · 搜索 · 译文 · 文字 · 画面 · 更多 | 设置. 设置 sits at the far right, after a divider.

The old 调整 button and its tabs are gone. Each panel has one job and no tabs.

## Visibility
- **Outside the window:** the toolbar is hidden.
- **Pointer inside the window:** the toolbar is faint (0.32 opacity).
- **Near the top edge, or any panel open:** the toolbar is fully shown.
- Buttons never move between these levels.

## Gestures and keys
There is no lyric bar; the user removed it on 2026-10-21. Every setting lives in its panel.

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Font size | Pinch on the lyrics |
| Scene | Two-finger swipe left or right on the canvas, which moves to the previous or next of the 4 categories |
| Play / pause | **Space**, sent to the current player. It works only when no text field has focus. |

- A gesture change shows a small notice at the bottom of the lyrics column, such as 「字号 22」 or 「封面」, which fades after about 1 s.
- There are no other listening shortcuts; the Command / Option shortcuts were removed.

## Panels
- **One panel per button.** Hover shows it temporarily; click pins it. **Hover and pin show the same content.**
- **Each panel fits on one screen**, max height 520 pt. **The panel's height fits its content**, so there is no empty space below it.
- **No explanatory paragraphs.** Use an ⓘ tooltip when a control needs one.
- **Each panel holds everything about its topic.**
- **Disclosure rows** such as 「更多文字选项」 are clickable across their full width and at least 28 pt tall.
- **On/off settings use the same switch style everywhere.** Actions such as 全屏 are buttons, set apart from the switches.
- **Rarely used settings live in the settings window**, not in toolbar panels.

| Button | Panel |
|---|---|
| 歌词库 | This song's versions grouped by type (原词 / 译文 / 读音 / 时间轴). The adopted one is checked; click another to adopt it. Each row shows source, date and line count. 「打开歌词库」 is at the bottom. |
| 搜索 | A search field prefilled with the current song. Results are grouped as **本地已存** and **在线**. Each row shows a cover thumbnail, title · artist · album, duration, and badges for what is saved (词 / 译 / 读). The adopted one is checked. A row's status reads 「已采用」, 「点击采用」 or 「搜索中…」. Up and down arrows move the selection and Return adopts it. Top 5 per group, plus 「全部结果」, which opens the full search. |
| 译文 | 翻译 / 读音. **AI model picker** and **思考强度 picker** (one row each). Both show display names; the current model is shown the same way as the others in the list. Choosing another model must switch and persist. The saved-translation version picker. 「翻译整首」 and 「重新翻译」. 新歌词自动翻译. 并排对比. |
| 文字 | **显示: 原文 / 译文 / 读音.** **原文与译文 size.** **对齐: 跟随场景 / 左 / 中 / 右.** 「跟随场景」 replaces 「自动」; its tooltip says which side the current scene uses. 清晰度 (关闭 / 文字阴影 / 柔和光晕, default 关闭). 罗马音 / 拼音. 注音排版. 读音与辅助字 size. 假名 size. The ⓘ sits on the same line as its label. |
| 画面 | The 4 categories from `V3SceneFamily`. Below them, the selected category's style list, including 经典版. 背景封面模糊. 显示歌曲缩略图 / 前景封面. **播放呈现 (标准播放栏 / 窗口边缘).** **背景动态 (关闭 / 轻柔 / 鲜明).** A collapsed 「更多画面选项」 holding the rest of the picture controls (取景方式, 前景封面尺寸与位置, 背景缩放, 悬停时显示播放信息). |
| 更多 | 当前歌词偏移: −0.1s, a value field, +0.1s, 归零. Window modes as **switches**: 桌面歌词, 顶部胶囊, 菜单栏歌词. 全屏歌词 is a button. 桌面歌词交互. 恢复歌词时间. |
| 设置 | No panel; it opens settings. |

**Nothing is removed.** Every control that was in a toolbar panel before 2026-10-20 stays reachable from its panel, folding into a collapsed section where needed. The settings window may show them as well.

**Moved to the settings window:** 翻译服务 login and connection details (the model picker stays in 译文), 悬停预览, 恢复此风格的默认值, and every explanatory paragraph.

**Removed from 更多:** 「歌词版本」, which 歌词库 now covers.

## Hover and pin rules
These apply to 歌词库, 搜索, 译文, 文字, 画面 and 更多.

- **A hover panel stays open while** the pointer is on the button, on the panel, or in a native menu inside it.
- **It closes** 180 ms after the pointer leaves.
- **Clicking pins a panel** in a separate tool window. Every click visibly changes something:

| Click | When | Result |
|---|---|---|
| A panel button | Nothing pinned, or only hovering it | Pin it |
| A panel button | That panel is already pinned | Close it |
| A panel button | Another panel is pinned | Switch to this one |
| 歌词库 or 搜索 | — | Open their window and close all panels |
| 设置 | — | Open their window and close all panels |

- **While pinned:** hovering other buttons does nothing.
- **Highlighting:** only the pinned panel's button is lit.
- **Escape** and the close button close all panels.
- **An outside click** closes only the hover panel, never a pinned one.

## Clicks must always land
A click on a toolbar button counts no matter which path delivers it. Each path calls `V3ToolbarModel.click`:
- the SwiftUI button;
- the first-click catcher, used when the window is not key or the app is inactive;
- the hover popover's event monitor, used when the popover window overlaps the button.

Clicks that land on the popover's transparent arrow or shadow area are forwarded to the toolbar underneath.

## Placement of the pinned window
- **Fits beside the main window on the right:** place it outside, 12 pt from the window.
- **Doesn't fit:** place it against the screen's right edge.
- **Never** to the left of the window.

## Appearance
- **Listening canvas:** always dark.
- **Hover panel:** dark frosted glass.
- **Pinned panel:** follows the system's light or dark setting.

## Priority
- **Every scene and style shows the player** (transport and progress) according to 播放呈现; none hides it permanently.
- An open panel takes priority over the toolbar.
- The toolbar takes priority over the window-edge controls.
- While the pointer is in the toolbar area or any panel is open, the edge play buttons stay hidden and only the progress rail shows.
